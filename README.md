# Helios

Helios is my go at having a small starter website that i can host some things on.

I am going to try and have a go at turning my notes on development into a small blog and possibly add some more things to this at a later date

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm dev
```
